## What is libft?

The libft project is a C library that provides a collection of useful functions for C programming. It includes a wide variety of functions for working with strings, memory, and other common data structures and algorithms.

The libft project is typically created as part of the curriculum for the 42 coding school, where students are required to implement the functions in the library themselves as a way of learning and practicing the basics of C programming. The goal of the project is to provide students with a solid foundation in C programming and to teach them the importance of creating clean, well-written, and maintainable code.

The libft library includes functions for working with strings, such as `ft_strlen` (which calculates the length of a string), `ft_strcpy` (which copies a string), and `ft_strdup` (which creates a duplicate of a string). It also includes functions for working with memory, such as `ft_memset` (which fills a memory area with a specific value), `ft_bzero` (which sets all the bytes in a memory area to zero), and `ft_memcpy` (which copies a memory area).

Additionally, the libft library includes functions for working with common data structures, such as arrays, linked lists, and binary trees. These functions include `ft_lstnew` (which creates a new linked list node), `ft_lstadd` (which adds a new node to the beginning of a linked list).

# Here are a few examples of functions that might be found in a library called "libft" that provides basic functionality for C programming:

1.  `ft_strlen()`: This function calculates and returns the length of a given string.
    
2.  `ft_strcpy()`: This function copies the contents of a string into another string.
    
3.  `ft_memset()`: This function fills the first `n` bytes of a memory area with a given byte.
    
4.  `ft_bzero()`: This function sets all the bytes of a given memory area to zero.
    
5.  `ft_isalpha()`: This function checks if a given character is an alphabetic letter.
    
6.  `ft_toupper()`: This function converts a given lowercase letter to uppercase.
    
7.  `ft_tolower()`: This function converts a given uppercase letter to lowercase.
    
8.  `ft_putstr()`: This function outputs a given string to the standard output (usually the screen).
    
9.  `ft_putendl()`: This function outputs a given string to the standard output, followed by a newline character.
    
10.  `ft_putchar()`: This function outputs a given character to the standard output.
